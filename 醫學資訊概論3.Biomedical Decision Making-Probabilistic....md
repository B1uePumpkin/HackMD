    - [ ] It is an iteration process and sequential, staged data collection, followed by data interpretation and the generation of hypotheses.
    - [X] The goal often can not narrow/generate a single diagnosis which serves as the basis for providing a more certainty of treatment to the patient.
    - [ ] It is a process of medical data collection and treatment id intimately tied to an ongoing process of hypothesis generation and refinement.

- 計算題
1. The polymerase chain reaction (聚合酶酵素連鎖反應)test, 簡稱PCR test 為一種基因改造生物檢測法, is a gene-amplication technique that can diagnose HIV test 目前改良後作為COVID-19的檢測。
 
    | PCR test  |COVID-19檢測<br>為正常總人數|COVID-19檢測<br>為不正常總人數|
    | --------- | -------- | -------- |
    |檢測結果為正常|  160 TN  |   20 FP  |
    |檢測結果為異常|   40 FN  |   80 TP  |
    
    根據上表檢測結果，分別計算下列三項檢測效能指標(計算至小數一位)。
    A) True-positive rate(TPR) =66.6%
    - $TPR= \frac{80}{80+40}=\frac{2}{3}$
    
    B) Ture-negative rate(TNR) =88.8%
    - $TNR= \frac{160}{160+20}=\frac{8}{9}$

    C) Prevalence檢測有病除以總數 =33%
    - $流行率= \frac{80+20}{160+40+20+80}=\frac{1}{3}$
    
    他們及其他檢測效能指標(Performance Indications) 之對應公式明列如下:
    - $TPR= \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
    - $TNR= \frac{TN}{TN+FP}$
    - $prevalence(流行率)= \frac{TP+FP}{TP+FN+TN+FP}$
    - $PV+= \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$
    - $PV-= \frac{TN}{TN+TP}$
    - $Correctness(正確性)= \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FN+FP}$



2. 根據以下決策樹(Decision Tree) ，計算Surgery之期望值並指出是否應進行Surgery?
```graphviz
digraph summary {
    edge [style="" dir="none"]
    st [label="start" fontsize=30 shape=box]
    op1 [label="D" shape=octagon]
    op2 [label="C" shape=octagon]
    op3 [label="B" shape=octagon]
    op4 [label="A" shape=octagon]
    re1 [label="Poor mobility
    6Years" shape=box]
    re2 [label="Full mobility
    10Years" shape=box]
    re3 [label="Whellchair-bound
    3Years" shape=box]
    re4 [label="Death
    0Years" shape=box]
    
    st->op1[label="Surgery" fontsize=20]
    st->re1[label="No surgery" fontsize=20]
    op1->op2[label="Survival
p=0.95" fontsize=10]
    op1->re4[label="Operative death
p=0.05" fontsize=10]
    op2->op3[label="No infection
p=0.95" fontsize=10]
    op2->op4[label="Infection
p=0.05" fontsize=10]
    op3->re1[label="p=0.4" fontsize=10]
    op3->re2[label="p=0.6" fontsize=10]
    op4->re3[label="p=0.95" fontsize=10]
    op4->re4[label="p=0.05" fontsize=10]
    }
```
A = 0.05x0+0.95x3=2.85
B = 10x0.6+6x0.4=8.4
C = Ax0.05+Bx0.95=8.1225
D = Cx0.95+0x0.05=7.716375
期望值=7.716375(年)>6(不做手術活6年)

Ans:要
